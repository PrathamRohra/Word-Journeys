# Word-Journeys

I recently completed my first MERN stack project, Word Journeys, which is a blog app. Developing the project was a great learning experience for me and I'm excited to continue to work on projects involving the MERN stack.

*Note: The API endpoints are not according to the REST architecture - will fix them in the future.*
