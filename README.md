# Word-Journeys

I recently completed my first MERN stack project, Word Journeys, which is a blog app. Developing the project was a great learning experience for me and I'm excited to continue to work on projects involving the MERN stack.

`Installation`
- `git clone https://github.com/PrathamRohra/Word-Journeys.git`
- `cd path/to/Word-Journeys`
- To run the frontend (Port 3000):
  - `cd client`
  - `npm run start`

- To run the backend (Port 5000):
  - `cd ..`
  - `cd server`
  - `node index.js`


*Note: The API endpoints are not according to the REST architecture - will fix them in the future.*
